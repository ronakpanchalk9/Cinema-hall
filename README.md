# Cinema-hall
I made a small basic program of Cinema Hall with the help of JAVA.
In this first you have to setup a Cinema Hall by adding number of rows and columns.
Then a menu will come out of that you could choose out of several options like Show seats, Book ticket, Statistics or Exit.
By choosing the Show seats menu it'll show you all the vacant seats denoted by 'S' 
after that you can book your seats by entering your favourable row and column then it'll tell you the price of that seat , once seat is booked you can check it by choosing show seats option.
At last but not least third option which tells you as a Cinema Manager all the profits, percentage of seats booked, no. of tickets purchased.
Its a very basic program but an interesting one. :))
